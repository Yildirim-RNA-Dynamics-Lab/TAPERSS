C++ Combinatorial Method for RNA structure Prediction.
Developed by Ivan Riveros in part using code from Kye Won Wang

Compilation (From Ivan_RNACMB directory): 'make -f makefile.production' OR 'make -f makefile.debug'

How to use:
This program can use either an input file or an inputfile + several flags in the standard input to understand what is being asked of it. [At the moment only the input file method 
can be used for all methods, which will fixed.]
To run with an input file:
./bin/Ivan_RNACMB -i Inputfile.txt
How to format inputfile.txt:
                                OPTION1 = [SELECTION1]
                                OPTION2 = [SELECTION2]
Be mindful of the spaces around the '='. They must be included for input to be correctly read. Example input shown in ExampleInput.txt

Options:
    SEQUENCE        Give the sequence to perform the specified action.
    OUTPUT          Define the output file name.
    OUTPUTACTION    Select how the output file will be written to.
                        Output options:
                            "w" - overwrite file (default if none is given).
                            "a" - append to end of given outputfile.
    TYPE            Select action to be taken.
                            Available actions:
                                "cmb"       -       Perform combinatorial run
                                "str"       -       Create a single structure from sequence and given index
                                "strlist"   -       Create several structures using a previous simulation output or equivalently formatted file.
    STRUCTCHECK     Select the type of structural checks to be performed. Structures that pass the check are written to file those that don't are discarded.
                            Available options:
                                "hairpin"   -   Check if structure resembles an RNA hairpin.
                                "none"      -   Perform no structural check.
    INPUTFILE       Define the input file to be used with "strlist" action.
    INDICES         Indices in form "0-0-0-0-0" to be used with "str" action. Number of indices must the
                    length of your sequence - 1.
    RMSD            Set RMSD cutoff value for overlapped dinucleotides.
    WCRMSD          Set RMSD cutoff value when comparing a WC structure and the closing basepairs of an RNA hairpin if the hairpin structcheck is selected.
    LIBRARY         Define a library location prototype. Give the filename/location of any library file but replace the dinucleotide sequence with XX. Program
                    will search for any files with that name structure.
                        Example: ./LIBRARY_FILES/AA_library_combined.txt => ./LIBRARY_FILES/XX_library_combined.txt
    WCLIBRARY       Same as the library option but for any Watson-Crick Libraries.

To run using flags (Note library file prototype must be defined in the input file):
./bin/Ivan_RNACMB -i [INPUTFILE] -s [SEQUENCE] -o [OUTPUT] -[other flags]
Flags:
    -o  [FILENAME]      Name output file to write to.
    -s  [SEQUENCE]      Sequence to use in performing action
    -t  [ACTION]        Select action to be taken.
                            Available actions:
                                "cmb" - Perform combinatorial run
                                "str" - Create a single structure from sequence and given index
    -x  [INDICES]       Indices in form "0-0-0-0-0" to be used with "str" action. Number of indices must the
                        length of your sequence - 1.
    -c                  Include all coordinates in output file.
    -r  [RMSD]          Set RMSD cutoff value for overlapped dinucleotides.
    -a                  Append output to end of selected output file.
